# CIS106 Amani Bhagwakar

## Assignment 1

Hello. I am Amani Bhagwakar. I am currently a student and University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. There are several reasons I am taking this course. Firstly, I am enrolled in this course to gain a greater understanding of computer science. Computer science is incredibly important in today's society, and I want to be aware of how it works. Also, I would like to teach Computer Science at the high school level in my future. As a future educator, I hope to teach my future students how code is taking over society, and the importance of having a basis in computer science in order to pursue any profession. With a basis in Computer Science, I hope to accomplish just this.
